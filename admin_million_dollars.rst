The Million Dollar Admin
========================

Django admin was first released in 2005 and it has gone through a lot of changes since then. Still the admin interface looks clunky compared to most modern web interfaces.

Jacob Kaplan-Moss, one of the core-developers of Django estimated that it will cost 1 million dollars to hire a team to rebuild admin interface from scratch.

Until we get 1 million dollars to revamp the admin interface, let's look into alternate solutions.

There are few opensource 3rd party packages like xadmin, django-admin2 which aimed to provide drop-in replacement for django. Even though these packages provide additional features to extend admin interface and provide better UI, they are not well maintained as django itself.
