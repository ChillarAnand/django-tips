Why this book?
----------------

In this data driven world, internal tools are often overlooked parts in companies. Without efficient tools for analytics and dashboards, cross department communications becomes a bottleneck as people spend more time everyday to get some data.

There are several tools built specifically for analytics and dashboards. But if you are using Django, you just use Django admin itself for most of these tasks.




Pre requisites
--------------
Readers should be familiar with basics of Django. They should have at least completed the polls tutorial available in the Django documentation.


Who should read this book?
---------------------------

Anyone who wants to learn how to customize and improve the performance of django admin.
